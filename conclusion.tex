\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this work, numerous methods have been utilised to tackle an author identification problem. The most successful of these is the bag-of-words Feature Kernel Neural Net built on a translation augmented dataset, which achieves 83\% accuracy and 0.43 loss. Estimating based on the leaderboard of the Kaggle competition \cite{kaggle}, this ranks in the middle of the submissions -- approximately 650th out of 1244.
