\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
A Kaggle competition was used as a basis for this report. The Kaggle competition
used is one that challenges teams to classify sentences from the works of three
different horror authors. The Kaggle competition was judged by the log-loss
achieved by classifiers - thereby excluding common techniques such as support
vector machines. 

This report looks at the different data processing techniques used as well as the effectiveness of neural nets compared to probabilistic techniques.
