\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
A Kaggle competition was used as a basis for this report. The Kaggle competition
challenges teams to classify sentences from the works of three
different horror authors. The competition was judged by the log-loss
achieved by classifiers. 

This report looks at the different data processing methodologies and compares
the effectiveness of several learning machines.
