The Kaggle competition underling this work is "Spooky Author Identification", from December 2017. It challenges teams to classify sentences from the works of three
different horror authors. Classifiers were evaluatied by the log-loss metric.

Though the competition entry window had passed at the time of writing, the leaderboards may still be used to benchmark the performance of any classifiers.
