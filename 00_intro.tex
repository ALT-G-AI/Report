\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
A Kaggle competition was used as a basis for this report. The Kaggle competition used is one that challenges teams to classify sentences from the works of three different horror authors. This is a challenge as the length of each data point limits the extent to which some classic document classification techniques can be used. 

This report looks at the different data processing techniques used as well as the effectiveness of neural nets compared to probabilistic techniques.
