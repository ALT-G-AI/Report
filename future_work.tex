The random forest and support vector machine could use derived features such as
those used by the bag of words neural network. This would likely allow them to
achieve sufficiently low bias as to be useful. They may generalise better than
the neural networks because the random forest is a very large ensemble and the
SVM selects the hyperplane with the largest margins.

The ensemble could be expended to include more classifiers and some additional
features so that it could perhaps learn which classifier to prefer depending
upon the features of the input sentence.
